                This website was previously live for some time, however I was not seeing the progress that I would have liked, and decided to take down the website, and revamp it. I ended up decided to code it myself instead of paying for a service such as wix, or domain.com to provide functionality. Sure it has the ability to change certain things, or add html snippets and whatnot, but I found that certain functionality or features were either restricted behind further payments and upgrades packages, or similar not possible due to the way the frameworks are set up. I also didn't like having to ask someone else for additional features when I knew I could do it myself and add things as needed.

                The website is going to have authentication, and backend functionality. I want to have users be able to login and be able to chat with like minded users who are enthusiastic about tech and the explosion of technology in our world. They will be able to watch tech videos together with a chat room to discuss the fascinating tech topics of our world day to day, among other features. 
                Furthermore, I want to be able to have e-commerce functionality and be able to have users add products to their carts to purchase, some external, some sold in house and shipped. Some being third party fulfillment center. I am going to complete the base website and add the e-commerce functionality first and foremost as a project in and of itself, and then once it is live, I will continue to add new features and functionality to the live website as available.
